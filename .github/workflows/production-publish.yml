# GitHub Actions Workflow: Publish Master Image
#
# Trigger: Runs on a push to the 'master' branch (e.g., after staging is merged).
#
# Jobs:
#   build-and-publish:
#     - Performs the mandatory CodeQL scan for Security Tab compliance.
#     - Builds the Docker image.
#     - Generates production tags for the image (e.g., 'latest' and 'v<sha>').
#     - Pushes the final image to ghcr.io.
