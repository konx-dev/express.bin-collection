# GitHub Actions Workflow: Pull Request Validation
#
# Trigger: Runs when a pull request is opened or updated that targets the 'staging' branch.
#          Can also be run manually via the Actions tab.
#
# Jobs:
#   validate-pr:
#     - Performs static analysis security scans on code and dependencies.
#     - Verifies that the Docker image can be built successfully.
#
# Purpose: Acts as a quality gate to ensure code meets security and build standards
#          before it is merged into the staging branch.
